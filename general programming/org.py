Question 1: Print the Organizational Structure

You are given an array where each element is a string containing names. The first name in each string (at index 0) represents the boss, and the subsequent names are the direct reports of that boss. Your task is to print the entire organizational structure in a hierarchical format.
Example:

Input:
[
    "Alice Bob Carol",
    "Bob Dave Eve",
    "Carol Frank Grace"
]
Output:
Alice
  Bob
    Dave
    Eve
  Carol
    Frank
    Grace

Question 2: Print the List of Skip Level Reports

Given the name of a manager, print the list of skip level reports (i.e., the employees who report to the manager's direct reports)
Input: Alice
Output:
    Dave
    Eve
    Frank
    Grace


Time Complexity
Building the Structure: 
O(nâ‹…m)
where 
n is the number of strings (managers) and 
m is the average number of words per string.

Traversing the Structure (Printing or Finding Reports): 
O(V+E)
where 
V is the number of nodes and 
E is the number of edges.

Space Complexity
Graph/Tree Representation: 
O(V+E)
